* Emacs OS

  #+CAPTION: EMACS OS
  #+NAME:   fig:EOS-screenshot

  [[./assets/eos.png]]

  Just another org-mode based emacs configuration,
  or a elisp interpreter desktop distribution.

* Introduction

  Using Emacs (Elisp interpreter) as the only IO bridge
  between human and machine. In another words, a emacs configuration
  well designed and integrated, that provides a generic
  computer environment for everyday use.

  We rely on org-mode to organize the whole configuration in a logic and
  manageable way, so the source code and its documentation are contained
  in only one file: ~init.org~.

  * Note: The word application(s) in this context means (any elisp
          packages and external programs) and will be used intangibly
          throughout this document.

** Features (overview):

    - Just one major language (Elisp) to conquer than all!
    - Information comes to you as required and not other way around.
    - Use the same keybinds everywhere (learn once, use forever and ever).

    - Use the same editor capabilities for all applications
      (or at least try it).

    - Use the same GUI Interface (frames/window/buffers) for all
      applications.

    - Just one development environment for all languages.
      - Editing
      - Navigation
      - Completion
      - Syntax check
      - Spell check
      - Syntax Highlight
      - Documentation access
      - Testing
      - Debugging
      - Versioning
      - Rationalization

    - Understand that data is generic and can be manipulated
      through different paths.

    - Huge improvements in productivity:
      - Stay focused, surfing in the same pleasant and comfortable
        flow (my prefer kind of mood).
      - No useless and annoying distractions.
      - Just do what was asked and nothing more.

    - Decrease the gap between the beginning and the end in any
      process of interest.
    - Absolute control!
    - All integrated and easily/transparent communication between peers:
      - Packages
      - Buffers/Windows/Frames
      - External applications

* Dependencies

  1. Cask
  2. Emacs >= 26.3

  Elisp packages will be described in the =applications= section.

** Optional

   External programs that are massively used by some Emacs packages
   used in this configuration to improve its usability.

   1. agrep
   2. global
   3. aspell (or ispell)
   4. compton
   5. transset
   6. rtags (server)
   7. irony (server)

* Tested on

  - FreeBSD 12.1 RELEASE

* Installation

  Download and execute the installation script:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
     sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esac-io/eos/master/scripts/install.sh)"
  #+END_SRC

  Script steps:

  1) Check dependencies
  2) Clone Cask and EOS repositories
  3) Backup ~.emacs.d~ directory
  4) Install third-party packages using cask: ~Cask~
  5) Build and compile: ~init.org~

* Usage

  Using this Emacs configuration isn't different of using
  Emacs vanilla itself with a “few” reforms.
  As such, the official Emacs tutorial is a great way to understanding
  a little bit of this amazing universe.

  So, open Emacs and press =C-h= (the help map prefix) and
  press =t= to evaluate ~help-with-tutorial~ function that will
  start the interactive tutorial.

  - Enjoy your late nights :)

  - Note: The main purpose of the Emacs tutorial is teach you
    the most important standard Emacs commands (functions/keybinds).

  - Note: Some keybinds will not be the same, in the next section
    will be available a overview on how/where we map elisp function.

** Keybinds

   Basically, new prefix maps are created for the most commonly
   used minor modes and their functions are mapped within
   their respective maps.

   After that, the prefix maps will be placed in the Ctl-x-map prefix
   map, resulting in the standardization of commands (functions)
   access sequences (keybinds or chords).

*** Basic

    If you do not understand the terminology of the tables below,
    it is advisable to read the emacs manual in the sections on
    keys and keymaps.

    - TIP: =C-h r= (info-emacs-manual)

*** Standard

    | Key        | Prefix | Description    |
    |            |        |                |
    | Meta (Alt) | M-     | Global Meta    |
    | Crtl       | C-     | Global Command |
    - Table 1.0 (Emacs Basic Prefix)

    | Keymap      | Prefix    | Available       |
    |             |           |                 |
    | Ctl-x-map   | C-x       | Always (Global) |
    | <minor>-map | C-x <key> | Always (Global) |
    | <major>-map | C-c       | Always (Major)  |
    - Table 1.1 (Emacs Basic Action Prefix)

*** C-x

    We define some new keymaps prefix, where the most
    common and used functions will be placed.
    The functions are divided between prefix keymaps
    according to their logical functionality and the mode in
    which they were defined.

    | Prefix Keymap       | Prefix | Description |
    |                     |        |             |
    | window              | C-x w  | Window      |
    | projectile          | C-x p  | Projects    |
    | flycheck            | C-x e  | Errors      |
    | tags                | C-x t  | Tags        |
    | dash                | C-x l  | Library     |
    | complete-prefix-map | M-`    | Complete    |
    - Table 1.2 (Global Minor/Actions Prefix Maps)

    - Note: The complete prefix map =M-`= are the only
      prefix that does not follow the specified pattern.

*** C-c

    Some maps will be used only in specific modes,
    like cc-mode for example:

    | Mode  | Keymap    | Prefix | Description |
    |       |           |        |             |
    | C/C++ | rtags-map | C-c r  | Rtags       |
    - Table 1.2 (Global Minor/Actions Prefix Maps)

    - TIP: You always can verify what keys are mapped using
      helm-descbinds (M-x helm-descbinds or C-h b), you also
      can use the chord: (prefix key + C-h)  or (prefix key + ?)
      for example:

      | Keybind   | Description            |
      | C-x ?     | global action map help |
      | C-x C-h   | global action map help |
      | C-x p ?   | project map help       |
      | C-x l C-h | library map help       |
      | C-c C-h   | major mode map help    |
      - Table 1.3 (Prefix Map Help)

*** Global

    We are not going to list all the keybinds, just the keybinds we
    have changed from the standard and some additional ones that we
    think are important.

    Remember that you always can call the functions =C-h k= (describe-key)
    and =C-h b= (describe-bindings) to require this information.

    | Keymap | Keybind | Function                                  |
    | Global | C-a     | eos/move/beginning-of-line                |
    | Global | C-M-v   | scroll-other-window                       |
    | Global | C-M-y   | scroll-other-window-down                  |
    | Global | M-i     | eos/edit/indent-region-or-buffer          |
    | Global | M-c     | comment-or-uncomment-region               |
    | Global | M-j     | eos/edit/duplicate-current-line-or-region |
    | Global | M-n     | eos/edit/move-lines-up                    |
    | Global | M-p     | eos/edit/move-lines-down                  |
    | Global | C-s-j   | buf-move-up                               |
    | Global | C-s-k   | buf-move-down                             |
    | Global | C-s-h   | buf-move-left                             |
    | Global | C-s-l   | buf-move-right                            |
    | Help   | C-h C-i | helm-info                                 |
    | Help   | C-h a   | helm-apropos                              |
    - Table 1.4 (Remapped)

*** Quality of life

    For the sake of sanity we unbind a lot of keys.
    See the unbind section at ~init.org~ file and comment
    out your missing chords.

    Note: We clean minor-mode-map-alist completely, this was proven
    to be a huge gain on productivity and pain relief.

* Cask (Package Manager)

  Cask is a project management tool for Emacs that helps automate the
  package development cycle; development, dependencies, testing,
  building, packaging and more.

  Cask can also be used to manage dependencies for your
  local Emacs configuration.

  It’s based on a Cask file, which identifies an Emacs Lisp package,
  provides meta information about the package
  and declares its contents and dependencies.

** Management
*** Add

    To add more packages just edit (that means write and save
    operations) the ~/.emacs.d/Cask~ file generated
    by the installation script, for example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    (depends-on "function-args")

    #+END_SRC

    Sometimes you want a different source than melpa,
    to specify use :git keyword, e.g:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    (depends-on "undo-tree"
            :git "http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git")

    #+END_SRC

    After that is required to call ~cask~, I generically used
    like this:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    $ cd ~/emacs.d; cask install

    #+END_SRC

    The command above will perform the installation of the added
    package.

    - TIP: If you encounter problems with missing dependencies when
      another source is used, put the dependency code snippet
      ~(depends-on "package-name)" above the target package, I guess
      cask install reads (organize the depends-on list data)
      the ~Cask~ file in a reverse stack.

    - Note: The ~/src/Cask~ is ignored by the version control
      using ~.gitignore~ mechanism.

*** Remove

    You have to manually remove the target package directory.
    To find out where the packages are installed use:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    $ cd ~/.emacs.d; cd $(cask package-directory)

    #+END_SRC

    - TIP: Usually this directory is located at:
           ~~/.emacs.d/.cask/<emacs-version>/<source>~

    And delete package target folder:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    $ rm -rf dashboard-20200121.1429

    #+END_SRC

    In this example, the dashboard will be removed and
    the configuration on init.org will remain unaffected,
    actually it will not enter the code block related to
    the dashboard (skipping it).

    - IMPORTANT: If just remove the package from ~Cask~ file and
                 not remove its directory ~init.org~ will
                 continue to load/customize it.

* Adapt

  If you want to modify any aspects (or extend) this configuration
  without touching the ~/src/init.org~, just edit/add your own elisp code
  at ~/src/eos-adapt.el~, this file is the last thing loaded on
  the ~/src/init.el~ script.

* Applications

  Well like was said, this configuration (EOS) is used as a desktop
  distribution, all common applications with different purposes and
  classification, so directly or indirectly they passe through the
  Elisp interpreter.

  The application list (organized by its classification) can be found
  at ~docs/apps.org~ and, of course, its configurations are done in the
  ~src/init.org~ file.

* Miscellaneous
** Advices

   1. Do one thing and do it well.
   2. If something is bothering you, fix it!
   3. Global behavior aways available and static.
   4. Few keybinds sets.

   5. Repeat keybinds for mode-specific commands
      according to their logical classification.

   6. Use the same action flow logic, for the same class of commands.
      Habits die hard (increases the usability!).

   7. Use as few modules(packages) as possible and always try to use
      modules already installed on emacs to meet your needs.
      If we can withdraw a module, do so! Most of the time it takes little
      or no effort, and the gain is considerable.
      So be alert to identify these situations!

   8. Prioritize emacs's native packages(buildin) over third-party.
      If any demand comes to light try to resolve with these packages
      first, then third-party packages already installed and
      finally(maybe) the internet. Sometimes a little extension
      on this blotted-packages sets, are everything we need to
      bring a new feature to live or resolve a issue.

   9. Successive refinements: in constant refactoring!
      Always improve, do not fear the winds of change!

* FAQ

  - Q: Mac/Windows will be supported any time soon?
  - A: Nope.

  - Q: Why don't you use evil/hydra/which-key/use-package?
  - A: It is not just a matter of taste, it is simply because
    they get in the way, disturbing, the desired transformation to
    occur, and I prefer a more direct, simply and effective approach.
    Remember that’s the way I think, you can always add these modules
    on your own and make your life a little more miserable, be my guess!

  - Q: And what about ivy/counsel/swiper?
  - A: Well, tried once (a friend recommendation), but never got used
    to it, then went back to Helm and never looked back, maybe it's
    that legacy part of my brain speaking louder, or I'm one of the
    lucky ones to not have any problems with it. Who knows? ...

  - Q: Why won't just use Doom/Centaur/Spacemacs or any other
    distribution?
  - A: Because I wanted to learn/understand more about Emacs (and
    Elisp) its details and usage, and make your own configuration
    is a great exercise which will provide more control/knowledge
    over your most used tool!

  - Q: Do you think that everyone who uses Emacs should make their own
    configuration ~init.el~?
  - A: For sure! It's fun like explore some dungeons and slay
    some dragons, the reward? Walk over the rotten and stinky
    carrion of your enemies, who were defeated by your will,
    and contemplate the symphony formed by the cry of despair
    contained in the last breath of their widows.

  - Q: Pull requests will be accepted in this repository?
  -  A: Probably not, Emacs configurations are too personal,
    fork it or copy any snippet of code that you like:
