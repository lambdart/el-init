;;; early-init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Emacs 27.1 introduced early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before
;; package and UI initialization happens, and before site files are loaded.

;; a big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
;; enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; in noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; In Emacs 27+, package initialization occurs before
;; `user-init-file' is loaded, but after `early-init-file'.
