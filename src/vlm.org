* VLM

  Some people (including me) have started to refer to
  =Emacs= as a =LISP MACHINE=. It is not strictly a lisp machine
  because, clearly, it is a software program and not a physical
  computer, but as that line starts to blur it seems like a useful
  epithet for =Emacs=, because these days it looks more and more like
  an operating system.

  A =Lisp Machine= is a generic term. A Lisp Machine is a
  computer whose operating system and applications are
  written in Lisp.

  So, =VLM= stands for =Virtual Lisp Machine= and the prefix
  =vlm-= will appear often through this document.

  Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald
  Knuth  in which a computer program is given an explanation of its
  logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with
  snippets  of macros and traditional source code, from which
  compilable source code can be generated.

  =Org-mode= is used to write and organize the configuration
  in a literate programming format, meaning it contains
  Elisp source code blocks - that will be tangled generating the
  =init.el= final script - and the referent documentation.

  When you start Emacs, it normally attempts to load
  your =init.el file=, that will =load*= and =set= the
  proper values to the customizable library's variables.

** Bootstrap
*** Header

    Define the package header to avoid warnings, and just a
    reminder this file will be used as a seed to generate the
    final ~init.el~ script.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    ;;; init.el --- Virtual Lisp Machine Configuration (init.el)

    ;;; Commentary:

    ;; ... Present day, present time ....

    ;;; Code:

    #+END_SRC

*** Lexical

    Lexical binding opens up many more opportunities
    for optimization, so programs using it are likely to run
    faster in future Emacs versions.

    Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency,
    which was added to Emacs in version 26.1.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

    #+END_SRC

*** Verify
**** Version

     Verify Emacs version.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

     (when (version< emacs-version "26.3")
       (error "This requires Emacs 26.3 and above!"))

     #+END_SRC

*** Loaddefs

    Loaddefs.el, automatically extracted autoloads!

    Just load the definitions using the =autoloads= facility
    (=loaddefs.el=), speeding up the process of initialization,
    that's why most of the =(require '<library>)= are commented
    through this configuration.

    The =autoload= facility lets you register the existence of a function or
    macro, but put off loading the file that defines it. The first call to
    the function automatically loads the proper library, in order to install
    the real definition and other associated code, then runs the real
    definition as if it had been loaded all along (lazy-load).

    Instead of installing a function by loading the file that contains it,
    or by evaluating the function definition, you can make the function
    available but not actually install it until it is first called.  This is
    called =autoloading=.

    When you execute an autoloaded function, Emacs automatically
    evaluates the file that contains the definition, and then calls the
    function.

***** Require

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      (require 'loaddefs)

      #+END_SRC

*** GC

    A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
    threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
    enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.

    Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy
    to minimize GC interference with the activity.

**** Customize

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

     ;; threshold inital value
     (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) ; 2^61 bytes

     #+END_SRC

*** Defines

    Your definitions as declare here. We have some
    =aliases=, =variables=, =keymaps= and =binds=.

**** Aliases

     Define some aliases to improve quality of life.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

     ;; yes or no
     (defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

     #+END_SRC

**** Variables

     Save =file-name-handle-alist=, it will be used to restore
     its original value.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

     (defvar saved-file-name-handler-alist
       file-name-handler-alist
       "Save `file-name-handler-alist' variable.")

     #+END_SRC

**** Keymaps

     Basically, new prefix maps are created for the most commonly used
     commands and their functions are mapped within their respective maps.

     After that, the prefix maps will be placed in the Ctl-x-map
     prefix, resulting in the standardization of commands (functions)
     access sequences - keybinds or chords.

     For the sake of sanity a lot of keybinds have been cleaned up,
     it's preferable (IMO) to have a small set of keybinds,
     consisting only of the most used ones, providing a more stable
     and less error prone overall usability.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      ;; (require 'warnings nil t)

      #+END_SRC

***** Customize

      ;; minimum severity level for displaying the warning buffer
      (customize-set-variable 'warning-minimum-level :error)

      ;; minimum severity level for logging a warning.
      (customize-set-variable 'warning-minimum-log-level :warning)

      #+END_SRC

*** Load-path

    When Emacs loads a Lisp library, it searches for the library in a list
    of directories specified by the variable 'load-path'. The value
    of this variable is a list of directories to search when
    loading files.

    If the environment variable =EMACSLOADPATH= is set, it modifies the
    above initialization procedure. Emacs initializes `load-path' based on
    the value of the environment variable.

    The syntax of =EMACSLOADPATH= is the same as used for 'PATH';
    directories are separated by ':' (or ';', on some operating systems).
    Here is an example of how to set =EMACSLOADPATH= variable (from a
    'sh'-style shell).

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    export EMACSLOADPATH=$EMACSLOADPATH:~/.emacs.d/lisp:~/.emacs.d/site-lisp

    #+END_SRC

    See ~defaults/default.xinitrc~ file for a detailed example.

    For each directory in `load-path', Emacs then checks to see if it
    contains a file `subdirs.el', and if so, loads it. The `subdirs.el'
    file is created when Emacs is built/installed, and contains code that
    causes Emacs to add any subdirectories of those directories to
    `load-path'. Both immediate subdirectories and subdirectories multiple
    levels down are added. But it excludes subdirectories whose names do
    not start with a letter or digit, and subdirectories named 'RCS' or
    'CVS', and subdirectories containing a file named =.nosearch=.

    See ~defaults/default.subdir.el~ file example.

*** Load-prefer

    In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
    prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
    to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

    #+END_SRC

*** Sound
**** Beeping
***** Disable

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes

      ;; do nothing (NOP)
      (customize-set-variable 'ring-bell-function (lambda () nil))

      #+END_SRC

** Libraries
*** Loaddefs

    The local ~lisp-loaddefs.el~ was generated by
    =update-directory-autoloads=, using the ~/emacs.d/lisp~
    directory as its base.

    Update/Generate =autoload= definitions for Lisp files in the directories.
    In an interactive call, you must give one argument, the name of a
    single directory. In a call from Lisp, you can supply multiple
    directories as separate arguments.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    ;; generated by `update-directory-autolods'
    (require 'lisp-loaddefs nil t)

    #+END_SRC

*** Ghcm

    Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy to minimize GC
    interference with the activity. During normal use a high GC
    threshold is set. When idling GC is immediately triggered
    and a low threshold is set.

     EasyPG is an all-in-one GnuPG interface for Emacs.
     It has two aspects: convenient tools which allow to use GnuPG
     from Emacs (EasyPG Assistant), and a fully
     functional interface library to GnuPG (EasyPG Library).

*** Storage
**** Forms

     Forms mode means visiting a data file which is supposed to consist
     of records each containing a number of fields. The records are
     separated by a newline, the fields are separated by a user-defined
     field separator (default: TAB). When shown, a record is
     transferred to an Emacs buffer and presented using a user-defined
     form. One record is shown at a time.

**** Mm-bodies

     This library handles MIME body (encode/decode).

     MIME is short for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions".
     This standard is documented in a number of RFCs;
     mainly RFC2045 (Format of Internet Message Bodies),
     RFC2046 (Media Types), RFC2047 (Message Header Extensions for
     Non-ASCII Text),  RFC2048 (Registration Procedures),
     RFC2049 (Conformance Criteria and Examples).

     It is highly recommended that anyone who intends writing
     MIME-compliant software read at least RFC2045 and RFC2047.

**** Shr

     This package takes a HTML parse tree (as provided by
     libxml-parse-html-region) and renders it in the current buffer.  It
     does not do CSS, JavaScript or anything advanced: It's geared
     towards rendering typical short snippets of HTML, like what you'd
     find in HTML email and the like.

*** Misc
**** Custom

     Emacs has many settings which you can change. Most settings are
     customizable variables, which are also called user options.
     There is a huge number of customizable variables,
     controlling numerous aspects of Emacs behavior.

     This package provides a convenient way of simultaneous browsing through
     the differences between a pair (or a triple) of files or buffers.
     The files being compared, file-A, file-B, and file-C (if applicable) are
     shown in separate windows (side by side, one above the another, or in
     separate frames), and the differences are highlighted as you step
     through them.

**** Jka-compr

     This package implements low-level support for reading, writing,
     and loading compressed files.  It hooks into the low-level file
     I/O functions (including write-region and insert-file-contents) so
     that they automatically compress or uncompress a file if the file
     appears to need it (based on the extension of the file name).
     Packages like Rmail, VM, GNUS, and Info should be able to work
     with compressed files without modification.

***** Require

     Major mode for viewing an archive file in a dired-like way.
     You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.
     Lettera no longer insert themselves.
     Type ‘e’ to pull a file out of the archive and into its own buffer;
     or click mouse-2 on the file’s line in the archive mode buffer.

     This is a major mode for file management operations.

     The most common operations performed on files or groups of files
     include creating, opening (e.g. viewing, playing, editing or

     for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and

*** Frames

    When Emacs is started on a graphical display, e.g., on the X Window
    System, it occupies a graphical system-level display region.  In this
    manual, we call this a “frame”, reserving the word “window” for the part
    of the frame used for displaying a buffer.

    - A frame initially contains one window, but it can be subdivided
      into multiple windows

    Configure/customize frame related options:

*** Windows
**** Window

     Emacs windows system.

     Characteristics:

     - Each Emacs window displays one Emacs buffer at any time.
     - A single buffer may appear in more than one window.
     - Emacs can split a frame into two or many windows.
     - Multiple frames always imply multiple windows, because each
       frame has its own set of windows.
     - Each window belongs to one and only one frame.

     Configure/customize windows standard/basic options,
     the description of each one can be found on the
     commentaries.

***** Display

      In its most simplistic form, a frame accommodates always
      one single window that can be used for displaying a buffer.
      As a consequence, it is always the latest call of display-buffer
      that will have succeeded in placing its buffer there.

**** Windmove

     This package defines a set of routines, windmove-{left,up,right,

     For example, `windmove-right' selects the window immediately to the
     right of the currently-selected one.

***** Cursor

      On a text terminal, the cursor's appearance is controlled by the
      terminal, largely out of the control of Emacs.
      Some terminals offer two different cursors: a visible static
      cursor, and a very visible blinking cursor.
      By default, Emacs uses the very visible cursor, and switches
      to it when you start or resume Emacs. If the variable
      visible-cursor is nil when Emacs starts or resumes, it uses
      the normal cursor.

*** Conding-System

    Emacs supports a wide variety of international character sets, including

    Arabic scripts, Brahmic scripts (for languages such as Bengali, Hindi,
    and Thai), Cyrillic, Ethiopic, Georgian, Greek, Han (for Chinese and
    Japanese), Hangul (for Korean), Hebrew and IPA.  Emacs also supports
    various encodings of these characters that are used by other
    internationalized software, such as word processors and mailers.

**** Minibuffer

     The minibuffer is where Emacs commands read complicated arguments,
     such as file names, buffer names, Emacs command names, or Lisp
     expressions. We call it the `minibuffer' because it's a special-purpose
     buffer with a small amount of screen space. You can use the usual Emacs
     editing commands in the minibuffer to edit the argument text.

     When the minibuffer is in use, it appears in the echo area, with a
     cursor. The minibuffer starts with a `prompt', usually ending with
     a colon.

*** Screen

    On a graphical display, such as on GNU/Linux using the X Window System,
    Emacs occupies a graphical window.  On a text terminal, Emacs occupies
    the entire terminal screen. We will use the term `frame' to mean a
    graphical window or terminal screen occupied by Emacs. Emacs behaves
    very similarly on both kinds of frames. It normally starts out with
    just one frame, but you can create additional frames if you wish.

**** Mode-line

     Each Emacs window (aside from minibuffer windows) typically has a mode
     line at the bottom, which displays status information about the buffer

     and major and minor modes.

     functions of these programs only.

     Implement some very basic protocols in Emacs Lisp (finger and whois)

     Support connections to HOST/PORT, generally for debugging and the like.
     In other words, for doing much the same thing as "telnet HOST PORT", and
     then typing commands.

*** Search
**** Find-lisp

     This is a very generalized form of find; it basically implements a
     recursive directory descent. The conditions which bound the search
     are expressed as predicates, and I have not addressed the question
     of how to wrap up the common chores that find does in a simpler
     format than writing code for all the various predicates.

**** Eldoc

     As you type a function's symbol name as part of a sexp,
     it will print the argument list for that function.
     Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
     type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
     calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
     the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
     that variable's meaning.

*** Utils
**** Bookmark

     Bookmarks are somewhat like registers in that they record positions
     you can jump to. Unlike registers, they have long names, and they
     persist automatically from one Emacs session to the next.
     The prototypical use of bookmarks is to record where you were
     reading in various files.

     The bookmark list is sorted lexically by default, but you can turn
     this off by setting bookmark-sort-flag to nil. If it is nil, then
     the list will be presented in the order it is recorded
     (chronologically), which is actually fairly useful as well.

**** Registers

     This library provides functions that emulates and somewhat extends the venerable

     pieces of buffer state to named variables. The entry points are
     documented in the Emacs user's manual.

** Extensions
*** Loaddefs

    The local ~lisp-loaddefs.el~ was generated by
    =update-directory-autoloads=, using the ~/emacs.d/site-lisp~
    directory, where the packages were installed.

    Update/Generate =autoload= definitions for Lisp files in the directories.
    In an interactive call, you must give one argument, the name of a
    single directory. In a call from Lisp, you can supply multiple
    directories as separate arguments.

*** Buffer
**** So-long

     When the lines in a file are so long that performance could suffer to an
     unacceptable degree, we say "so long" to the slow modes and options enabled
     in that buffer, and invoke something much more basic in their
     place.

**** Iedit

     This package includes Emacs minor modes (iedit-mode and
     iedit-rectangle-mode) based on a API library (iedit-lib) and allows you to edit
     one occurrence of some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and
     simultaneously have other occurrences edited in the same way, with visual
     feedback as you type.

**** Undo-tree

     Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in
     most software, it allows you to recover *any* past state of a buffer
     (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you
     redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo
     system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that
     replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system.

      #+END_SRC

*** CLI

    Command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that is
    used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the
    user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into
    the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.

**** Shell

     In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an
     operating system's services.

     This package defines a shell-in-a-buffer (shell mode) built on
     top of comint mode.  This is actually cmushell with things renamed
     to replace its counterpart in Emacs 18.  cmushell is more
     featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.

     Since this mode is built on top of the general command-interpreter-in-
     a-buffer mode (comint mode), it shares a common base functionality,
     and a common set of bindings, with all modes derived from comint mode.
     This makes these modes easier to use.

                   (setq truncate-lines nil)))

       #+END_SRC

**** Eshell

     Despite the sheer fact that running an Emacs shell can be fun, here
     are a few of the unique features offered by Eshell:

     - Integration with the Emacs Lisp programming environment
     - A high degree of configurability.

     - The ability to have the same shell on every system Emacs has been
       ported to. Since Eshell imposes no external requirements, and
       relies upon only the Lisp functions exposed by Emacs, it is quite
       operating system independent. Several of the common UNIX
       commands, such as ls, mv, rm, ln, etc., have been implemented in
       Lisp in order to provide a more consistent work environment.

       - If there is a command on disk, it will be executed
         as in a normal shell.  If there is no command by that name on disk,
         but a Lisp function with that name is defined, the Lisp function
         will be called, using the arguments passed on the command line.

*** Managers
**** Windows (X)

     A window manager is system software that controls the placement
     and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical
     user interface. Most window managers are designed to help provide
     a desktop environment.

     Finally an Emacs window means X11/Xorg WINDOW as well :D!
     Thanks to EXWM! (great library!).

***** Exwm

**** Packages

     A package manager or package-management system is a collection of
     software tools that automates the process of installing,
     upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a
     computer's system environment (like EMACS) in a consistent manner.

***** Packages

      The idea behind package.el is to be able to download packages
      and install them. Packages are versioned and have versioned
      dependencies.

       #+END_SRC

**** Files

     A file manager or file browser is a computer program that provides
     a user interface to manage files and folders.

*** Emulators

    An emulator is hardware or software that enables one
    computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer
    system (called the guest).

    An emulator typically enables the host system to run software
    or use peripheral devices designed for the guest system.

**** Terminal

     A terminal emulator, terminal application, or term
     is a computer program that emulates a video terminal within
     some other display architecture.

***** Term

      Command-interpreter-in-a-buffer package (term mode).
      The idea is that you can build specific process-in-a-buffer
      modes on top of term mode -- e.g., lisp, shell, scheme, T, soar, ...

      It seems that ~sh~ shell works better with term.

*** Session
**** Desktop

     This library provides ways to save the state of Emacs from one session to
     another. Once you save the Emacs “desktop”—the buffers, their file
     names, major modes, buffer positions, and so on—then subsequent Emacs
     sessions reload the saved desktop.

     By default, the desktop also tries to save the frame and window configuration.
     When the desktop restores the frame and window configuration, it uses
     the recorded values of frame parameters, disregarding any settings for
     those parameters you have in your ~init~ file.

*** Apparence
**** Icons
***** All-the-icons

      This package is a utility for using and formatting various Icon
      fonts within Emacs.  Icon Fonts allow you to propertize and format
      icons the same way you would normal text. This enables things such
      as better scaling of and anti aliasing of the icons.

**** Gnus

     - News: This is what you are supposed to use this thing for—reading news.
       News is generally fetched from a nearby NNTP server, and is
       generally publicly available to everybody.

     - Mail: Everything that’s delivered to you personally is mail. Some
       news/mail readers (like Gnus) blur the distinction between mail
       and news, but there is a difference.
       Mail is private. News is public.
       Mailing is not posting, and replying is not following up.

     - Reply: Send a mail to the person who has written what you are
       reading.

     The Gnus Newsreader:

     You can read news (and mail) from within Emacs by using Gnus.
     The news can be gotten by any means: NNTP, local spool or
     your box file.

*** Chat
**** Rcirc

     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of instant communication over
     the Internet. It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many)
     communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows
     one-to-one communication.

     Rcirc has simple defaults and clear and consistent behavior.
     Message arrival timestamps, activity notification on the mode line,
     message filling, nick completion, and keepalive pings are all
     enabled by default, but can easily be adjusted or turned off.  Each
     discussion takes place in its own buffer and there is a single
     server buffer per connection.

*** Launchers

    An application launcher is a computer program that helps a user
    to locate and start other computer programs.

**** Cannon

     Dmenu is a fast and lightweight dynamic menu for X.
     It reads arbitrary text from stdin, and creates a
     menu with one item for each line. The user can then select an item,
     through the arrow keys or typing a part of the name,
     and the line is printed to stdout.

     Cannon mimics Dmenu inside Emacs with the help of minibuffer.

**** Org

     Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and doing
     project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

     Org mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that
     contain information about projects as plain text.  Org mode is
     implemented on top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep
     the content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
     structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily
     created with a built-in table editor.  Org mode supports ToDo
     items, deadlines, time stamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically
     compiles entries into an agenda that utilizes and smoothly
     integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.  Plain text
     URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB
     entries, and any files related to the projects.  For printing and
     sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured ASCII
     file, as HTML, or (todo and agenda items only) as an iCalendar
     file. It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked
     webpages.

**** Remember

     Todo lists, schedules, phone databases... everything we use
     databases for is really just a way to extend the power of our
     memory. To be able to remember what our conscious mind may not
     currently have access to.

     "Remember" is a mode for remembering data. It uses whatever
     back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the data, but it's
     main intention is to allow you to express as _little_ structure as
     possible up front.

     There are many different databases out there -- and good ones --
     which this mode is not trying to replace. Rather, it's how that
     data gets there that's the question. Most of the time, we just
     want to say "Remember so-and-so's phone number, or that I have to
     buy dinner for the cats tonight."

*** Blogs

    A blog (a truncation of 'weblog') is a discussion or informational
    website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete,
    often informal diary-style text entries (posts).

    Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so
    that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.

**** Org-weblog

     Static blog generators are a dime a dozen.
     This is one more, which focuses on being simple.
     All files are simple org-mode files in a directory.

     The only requirement is that every org file must have a:

     To switch to a new tags table, do not set `tags-file-name; instead,
     invoke ‘visit-tags-table’, which is the only reliable way of
     setting the value of this variable, whether buffer-local or global.

     debugging mode, the Python debugger PDB, and the Java Debugger
     JDB.

     This mode acts as a graphical user interface to GDB.  You can interact with
     GDB through the GUD buffer in the usual way, but there are also further
     buffers which control the execution and describe the state of your program.
     It separates the input/output of your program from that of GDB and displays
     expressions and their current values in their own buffers.  It also uses
     features such as the fringe/display margin for breakpoints, and
     the toolbar (see the GDB Graphical Interface section in the Emacs info
     manual).

*** Slime

    SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.

    SLIME extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in
    Common Lisp. The features are centered around slime-mode, an Emacs

    While lisp-mode supports editing Lisp source files, slime-mode
    adds support for interacting with a running Common Lisp process
    for compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and so on.

** Cleanup

   A lot of commands are not used as often so they are cleanup
   (unbounded), it's preferable (IMHO) for quality of life
   a small set of keybinds and call/access this exotics commands
   with =execute-extended-command= know as =M-x= or even better
   the =minibuffer console=.
